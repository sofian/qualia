/*
 * StaticAllocator.h
 *
 * An allocator (see Allocator.h) that "allocated" memory based on a
 * pre-allocated static memory pool/buffer. Useful to manage memory on
 * architectures that don't support well dynamic allocation (such as
 * AVR-based systems). On such systems, it is usually recommended NOT
 * to use dynamic allocation to avoid problems.
 *
 * WARNING: Calling StaticAllocator::free() does NOT free the pointer at all. You should in fact
 * NEVER have to call that function (because the memory then becomes completely useless). The
 * object keeps track of any calls to free() by incrementing the nLeaks counter. The variable
 * lastLeak is also updated with the value of the pointer on which free() was called last.
 *
 * NOTE: An alternative is to tune the heap start and end in malloc.
 * http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/malloc.html
 *
 * Usage:
 * <code>
 * unsigned char mybuffer[100];
 * StaticAllocator alloc(mybuffer, 100);
 * int* myarray = (int*)alloc.malloc(10*sizeof(int));
 * Object myobject = new(alloc) Object(1,2);
